# Cotton Diseases Detection
* Link of Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vdr9CC9ChYVW2iXp6PlfyMOGD-4Um1ue
* The datasets consists of images of cotton plants with diseases.
* Here we have trained the model with Resnet152V2 and InceptionV3.
* After training the data, watching the training accuracy and validation accuracy we can say that both the models are having almost same accuracy that's training accuracy ~98% and validation accuracy ~96%.
* For production we can use InceptionV3 as it has less trainable parameters and it is giving similar accuracy as Resnet152V2 which as comparitively much high trainable parameters.
* The accuracy and loss graphs are given in the repo.
